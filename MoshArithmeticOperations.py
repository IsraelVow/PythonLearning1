#In python there are two type of numbers, 
#There are Integers and Float
#Integers are whole number (2,3,24)
#Floats are Decimal number (1.3,3.4,4.4)

# a single division operator in python will return a floating value
#print(10 / 3)
# while a double division operator will return an integer value
#print(10 // 3)

#asides the - + * operators, the % (called modulus) this return the remainder of any division
#it the division is divisible it returns 0, if it has a remainder, it returns that remainder
#print(100 / 7)

#Last operator is Exponent which is represented by **
#print(30 ** 2)
# raised to the power of the number 
# Which 30 * 30 = 900
# if its 10 ** 4
#print(10 ** 4)
# which is 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10000

#In Python theres the Augemented Assignment operator
#we are enhancing the assignment operator
# used to increment a given number
# say you store 10 in a variable and u want to increment it by 3
# you can say 
#x = 10
#x = x + 3
#print(x)
#or writing the same code in a shorter form
#x += 3
#since x is already 10, adding the plus and equals symbol will increment the value of x by the given number(3)

#order of PRecedence or priority in python
# Parenthesis ()
# Exponetiation (**)
# Unary Plus and Minus (+x,-x)
# Multiplication, Division, Floor Division(*,/,//)
# Additiion and subtration (+, -)
# Comparison Operators (==, !=, <,>,<=,>=)
# Boolean NOT(not)
# Boolean AND (and)
# Boolean OR(or)

#Note that these rules can be overrideen by using parenthesis
